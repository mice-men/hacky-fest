        <p class="p1">Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. Every October, developers from around the world come together to contribute to open source projects, learn new skills, and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>
        <p class="p2">Participants can earn rewards such as limited-edition T-shirts and stickers by making at least four pull requests to any public GitHub repository during the month of October. The event encourages collaboration, learning, and community building within the open source ecosystem.</p>
